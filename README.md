# My projects

In this readme I'd like to present my favourite projects:

**[`BMP388-STM32`](https://github.com/MSlomiany/BMP388-STM32)** - library I wrote to handle BMP388 pressure sensor which I've been using for research in my bachelor thesis. Written in C, specifically for STM32 microcontrollers, features full Doxygen documentation.

**[`ARDUINO_22_12_19`](https://github.com/MSlomiany/ARDUINO_22_12_19)** - library with basic functions for Arudino Uno. Written in C++, allows to interact with some of the MCU's periphereals as objects.

**[`myMatlab`](https://github.com/MSlomiany/myMatlab)** - my favourites scripts written in Matlab.

**[IPAS](/Papers/IPAS.pdf)** - The International Planetary Aerial Systems Challenge was a competition for university students which challenges to design Mars Aerial System (Vehicle) which shall be fully equipped and mission ready for Operation on Mars. I conducted research to determine environmental conditions and proposed a comprehensive avionics system. My team won the 1st place.

**[IRDC](/Papers/IRDC.pdf)** - The International Rover Design Challenge was a competition for university students which challenges to design Mars rovers which shall be fully equipped and mission ready for Operation on Mars. I designed a electrical and navigation subsystems for a guidance in lava tubes. My team won the 1st place.

**[TMM](/Papers/TMM.pdf)** - Telerobotic Mars Mission was an international competition to design a concept of a future Mars mission. We won the 2nd place. I was responsible for the aerial component of the mission - I proposed a set of aircraft and designed a control & navigation system adapted to the Mars environment.
